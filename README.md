# Balanced Binary Search Tree

## Description

A balanced binary search tree (BST) is a data structure where each node has at most two child nodes, and the heights of the left and right subtrees of any node differ by at most one. This ensures efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations. Popular types include AVL trees and Red-Black trees, and they're used to implement efficient data structures like sets, maps, and dictionaries.
